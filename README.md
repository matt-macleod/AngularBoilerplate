# AngularBoilerplate

Just a simple Angular setup with no backend. 

Simply render the file `views/home.html` in your browser to see the angular data binding a hello world message. 

I've included `Bootstrap 3.3.5` and `jQuery- 1.11.3` for your convenience. This is a really fun boilerplate
for when you want to quickly hack something together or test Angular concepts on a blank slate. 

Enjoy! :)
